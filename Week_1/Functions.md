## Importing Helper Functions

Start by importing the necessary helper functions:

```python
from helper_functions import *
```
This includes functions like:

`print_llm_response()` — Sends a prompt to an LLM and prints the response.

`get_llm_response()` — Sends a prompt to an LLM and returns the response as a string.

## Review: Functions You Have Used
Some functions you've already encountered:

```python
print("¯\_(ツ)_/¯")
print_llm_response("What is the capital of France?")
type(17)  # Displays the data type (int)
```
