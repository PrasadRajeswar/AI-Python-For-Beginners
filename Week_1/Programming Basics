# Python Programming Basics   
Welcome to **Python Programming Basics**!  
This guide is designed for absolute beginners who are just starting out on their programming journey. We'll walk you through your very first lines of Python code — from printing a simple message to making and fixing your first error. By the end, you'll be comfortable writing basic Python programs and understanding what they do.

Let’s dive in and start coding!

## 1. Hello, World!

Below is the code for the "Hello, World!" program that you can execute in Python:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
Congratulations! You have just joined the millions of people who have started their computer programming adventure by running this simple code.

## 2. Hello, You!    
Let's create Python code to say hello to you instead of the world. Here are the steps to follow:

Open the chatbot.

Type the following prompt (substituting your name for mine):

```python
#Modify the code below to have it say hello to me.
print("Hello, World!")
#My name is Andrew
```
Paste the output code in the cell below using Ctrl+V (or Command+V on Mac).

Press `Shift + Enter` to submit your prompt.

Once the chatbot has returned the code, you can copy and paste it into the cell below. Only copy the code inside the black box — don't copy any conversation text that the chatbot writes.

```python
# PASTE CODE FROM CHATBOT ON THE NEXT LINE IN THIS CELL
print (" ")
```
You should now see Python print out "Hello," followed by your name.

## 3. Say Hello to Someone You Love!     
Copy and paste (or just type out) the "Hello, World!" code in the cell below. Then, modify the text inside the quotation marks to say hello to your best friend, favorite pet, or anyone else you love.

```python
# ADD YOUR CODE ON THE NEXT LINE
print ("  ")
```
## 4. Comments in Code     
You may be wondering what the text in the cells above that starts with the `#` symbol is. This is a comment line. It tells Python to ignore anything that follows on that line after the `#` symbol. Comments are used to help other humans understand what your code does.

Try running the next cell by pressing Shift+Enter — what do you think will happen?

```python
# THIS IS A COMMENT - PYTHON WILL IGNORE THIS LINE
#Print("hello world")
```
The cell above runs just like the code you ran before, except this time, nothing appears on the screen. A comment line is a valid piece of Python code that tells Python to ignore the text. Because there was no output to return, it seems like "nothing happened."

Now, run the next code cell:

```python
print("This is a print statement!")
```
Next, click into the cell again and type a # at the start of the line. What do you think this change will result in? Run the cell by pressing Shift + Enter to check!

You can have multiple comment lines in your code, including one after another, and dispersed throughout your code:

```python
# This is an example of code with multiple
# comments, including this one which
# spans multiple lines
print("Hello, Andrew!")
# Follow up with an additional print command
print("How is your day going?")
```
## 5. Making Mistakes is No Big Deal!     
Run the code in the next cell to see an example of how Python responds to code with an error in it.

```python
print("Hello, Andrew!)
```
You can ask the chatbot to help you fix this code:

Open the chatbot.

Enter the following prompt:

```python
What is wrong with this code, and how do I fix it?
print("Hello, Andrew!")
```
Fix the code in the next cell based on the chatbot's recommendation and run the cell using Shift+Enter to see if the fix worked!

```python
# Edit the code on the next line to correct the error 
print("Hello, Andrew!")
```
## Practice
You can practice what you've learned in this lesson by trying out the code exercises below. For each one, follow the instructions in the comment line, then write your code on the next line below the comment. Once you are done, run your code by typing Shift + Enter. You can do this as many times as you like.

```python
# Write code that displays your favorite color
# Write code that answers the question "How are you feeling today?"
# Alter your code from the previous cell so that it will cause an error when you run it
# Ask an LLM to help you fix the error in the code in the previous cell (or fix yourself) and
# then type the corrected code on the next line:
```
