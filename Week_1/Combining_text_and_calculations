# Lesson 7: Displaying Text and Calculations Together

In this lesson, you will learn how to combine text (strings) and numbers (integers and floats) to display results in a readable way using **f-strings** in Python.

## Review: Strings, Integers, and Floats

- **Strings** (text):  
  `"Hello, world"`, `"My favorite drink is Earl Grey tea"`

- **Integers and Floats** (numbers):  
  `42`, `3.14`

## Printing Data

Printing a string:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Mixing Strings with Computations: f-Strings
If you want to combine a calculation with text in the output, use an f-string:

Incorrect way (just prints the formula):

```python
print("The temperature 75F in degrees Celsius is ((75 - 32) * 5 / 9)C")
```
Correct way using f-string:

```python
print(f"The temperature 75F in degrees Celsius is {(75 - 32) * 5 / 9}C")
```
In an f-string:

Prefix the string with f

Insert expressions inside {}
