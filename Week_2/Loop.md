# Lesson 2: Repeating Tasks with For Loops

Welcome! In this lesson, you’ll learn about the **for loop**, a fundamental programming tool that allows you to **repeat tasks automatically** for every item in a list.

## Getting Started

Import the required helper functions:

```python
from helper_functions import print_llm_response, get_llm_response
```
These functions will help you interact with the language model.

## Review: Previous Lesson Recap
Previously, you worked with this list of tasks:

```python
list_of_tasks = [
    "Compose a brief email to my boss explaining that I will be late for tomorrow's meeting.",
    "Write a birthday poem for Otto, celebrating his 28th birthday.",
    "Write a 300-word review of the movie 'The Arrival'."
]
print(list_of_tasks)
```
You manually passed each task to `print_llm_response()`, which was repetitive.
---

## Introduction to For Loops
Instead of repeating code manually, for loops automate the repetition:

```python
for task in list_of_tasks:
    print(task)
```
Passing each task to the LLM automatically:

```python
for task in list_of_tasks:
    print_llm_response(task)
```
How it works:

`task` is assigned each item in `list_of_tasks` one by one.

The code inside the loop (the indented block) runs for each task.

## Using For Loops with AI Tasks
Here’s the pattern again:

```python
for task in list_of_tasks:
    print_llm_response(task)
```
✅ Notice the colon : at the end of the for line and the indentation of the block below it.
---

## Common Mistakes: Indentation
Incorrect:

```python
for task in list_of_tasks:
print_llm_response(task)  # ❌ This will cause an IndentationError.
```
Correct:

```python
for task in list_of_tasks:
    print_llm_response(task)  # ✅ Correct indentation!
```
Indentation tells Python which lines of code are inside the loop.

## Iterative Prompt Updating
You can dynamically create prompts for each item in a list!

Example: Describe ice cream flavors.

```python
ice_cream_flavors = [
    "Vanilla",
    "Chocolate",
    "Strawberry",
    "Mint Chocolate Chip"
]

for flavor in ice_cream_flavors:
    prompt = f"""For the ice cream flavor listed below, 
    provide a captivating description that could be used for promotional purposes.

    Flavor: {flavor}
    """
    print_llm_response(prompt)
```
---

## Saving Results to a List
You can store the AI's outputs into a new list using `.append()`:

```python
promotional_descriptions = []

for flavor in ice_cream_flavors:
    prompt = f"""For the ice cream flavor listed below, 
    provide a captivating description that could be used for promotional purposes.

    Flavor: {flavor}
    """
    description = get_llm_response(prompt)
    promotional_descriptions.append(description)

print(promotional_descriptions)
```
Now you have a list of generated descriptions ready for use!

## Extra Practice
1. Fix the Code (Syntax Error)
Incorrect:

```python
for flavor in ice_cream_flavors;
    print(ice_cream_flavors)
```
Correct:

```python
ice_cream_flavors = ["Chocolate", "Mint Chocolate Chip"]

for flavor in ice_cream_flavors:
    print(flavor)
```
2. Translate Flavors into Spanish
```python
ice_cream_flavors = ["Vanilla", "Strawberry"]

for flavor in ice_cream_flavors:
    prompt = f"""Translate the following ice cream flavor into Spanish:
    Flavor: {flavor}
    Provide only the translation."""
    
    print_llm_response(prompt)
```
3. Fix Typos in Words
```python
words_with_typos = ["Aple", "Wether", "Newpaper"]
words_without_typos = []

for word in words_with_typos:
    prompt = f"""Fix the spelling mistake in the following word: {word}
    Provide only the corrected word."""
    
    correct_word = get_llm_response(prompt)
    words_without_typos.append(correct_word)

print(words_without_typos)
```
---

## Summary
- For loops automate actions for all items in a list.

- Indentation is critical for defining loop blocks.

- Dynamic prompts can be generated by combining lists and loops.

- Save results efficiently using .append() to build new lists.
