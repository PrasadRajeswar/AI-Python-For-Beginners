# 📊 AI Python for Beginners

Welcome to the **AI Python for Beginners** repository, inspired by DeepLearning.AI's [AI Python for Beginners](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/ai-python-for-beginners/lesson/oa6j1/data-in-python) course. This project is tailored for newcomers to Python, focusing on understanding and manipulating various data types using interactive notebooks and AI-assisted learning.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To introduce fundamental Python data types and structures, enabling learners to:

- Recognize and utilize basic data types: integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- Understand and implement data structures: lists and dictionaries.
- Perform basic data operations and manipulations.
- Leverage AI tools for real-time coding assistance and feedback.
