## 🎯 Objective

To introduce fundamental Python data types and structures, enabling learners to:

- Recognize and utilize basic data types: integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
- Understand and implement data structures: lists and dictionaries.
- Perform basic data operations and manipulations.
- Leverage AI tools for real-time coding assistance and feedback.
